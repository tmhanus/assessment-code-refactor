**.NET Backend Developer Homework Assessment**

The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to refactor, design, and assess code for production readiness in a real-world context. Your task is to analyze the provided source code and make it meet modern, production-grade standards while adhering to clean code principles. **Do not implement new functionality beyond what is described below.**

---

### **Instructions**

1. **Refactor the Code**
   - Refactor the provided code to follow the **SOLID principles**.
   - Ensure the code is maintainable, modular, and adheres to industry best practices.
   - Identify and mitigate any potential issues, such as tight coupling, hardcoded dependencies, or risks introduced by the current design.

2. **Introduce Tests**
   - Add unit tests to cover the key functionalities in the code.
   - Ensure the logic for fetching the product, processing payments, and sending email confirmation is testable.
   - Mock external dependencies (e.g., database and email service).

3. **Make the Code Maintainable**
   - Ensure the code is clean, readable, and easy to understand for other developers.
   - Consider design patterns or architectural improvements that may improve long-term maintainability.

4. **Assess Production Readiness**
   - Analyze the code and identify **what is missing** to make it production-ready.
   - List missing elements or areas that need improvement in a brief summary. (Do not implement these.)
   - Consider aspects like error handling, security, scalability, and operational concerns.

---

### **Current Context**

The existing application is a simple **Order Processing API** with the following features:
- A POST endpoint at `/api/order/process` that processes an order.
- Fetches product details from a SQLite database (`Products` table).
- Supports two payment types: `CreditCard` and `PayPal`.
- Sends a confirmation email to a user using an external email service.

#### **Database Schema**
The database currently contains only one table, `Products`:

| Id  |   Name   | Type  | Price  |
|:---:|:--------:|:-----:|:------:|
| 1   | Product1 | Type1 | 1.6    |
| 2   | Product2 | Type2 | 13.5   |

---

### **Expectations**

- You will work on refactoring the provided code while keeping the following key areas in mind:
  - Separation of concerns.
  - Dependency injection.
  - Clear, reusable, and testable logic.
  - Secure handling of user input and external interactions (e.g., database and HTTP requests).

- You should create the following deliverables:
  1. **Refactored Code**: Submit a fully refactored and maintainable version of the provided source code.
  2. **Unit Tests**: Include unit tests demonstrating proper coverage of the key functionalities.
  3. **Production Readiness Report**: Provide a short summary (1-2 paragraphs) of what is missing to make the application production-ready. Examples include logging, proper error handling, or security hardening.

---

### **Time Allocation**
You are expected to spend approximately **4 hours** on this task. Focus on demonstrating your skills, but do not over-optimize or go beyond the scope of the assignment.

---

### **Submission**
- Submit the refactored code and unit tests in a GitHub repository or as a ZIP file.
- Include the production readiness report as a separate README file or in the comments of your code.

---

This assignment is designed to assess your skills in:
- Code refactoring and adherence to best practices.
- Writing testable and maintainable code.
- Identifying and addressing production-critical issues.
- Your ability to work within the constraints of a real-world system.

Good luck!
